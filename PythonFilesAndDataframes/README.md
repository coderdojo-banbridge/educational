# General Notes
This repo contains some sample python files to help with the CoderDojo Banbridge Astro Pi Space Mission Project.

## filenaming.py
This shows some examples of generating file names with timestamps in them.
I put in an example of creating 10 simple text files with different names.
You will be creating csv files as explained in the data frame stuff below.

## example_dataframe.py

This file provides some examples of creating and using data frames with Pandas.
You can think of a data frame as an in-memory spreadsheet where you can store and access your data.
You read from a csv file or write to it.
Remember that you will need to install pandas.

You can do that by typing

	pip install pandas

in a terminal.


The best thing to do in both cases is to run the code first.
Just save the files somewhere and run them as usual.
It will print out stuff to help you understand.

e.g.

* python filenaming.py
* python example_dataframe.py
