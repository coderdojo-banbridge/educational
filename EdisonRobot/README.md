# Edison: Wheels & Motion

## What you will make

The **Edison** Robot is equipped with **sensors, outputs** and **motors** that introduce you to
the amazing world of **robotics**. Using the **drag** and **drop** editor, you will **program**
the Edison to tell it how to think, behave and respond to it's environment.

## What you will learn

By programming with the Edison, you will learn:

* How to control LEDs, Buzzers and motors
* How to program loops, conditional statements and create variables
* How to react to events using sensors
* How to communicate to other robots using IR blasters and receivers
